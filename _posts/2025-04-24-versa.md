# Introducing VERSA: A Comprehensive Speech and Audio Evaluation Toolkit

The WavLab team is excited to announce the public release of **VERSA** (Versatile Evaluation of Speech and Audio), our comprehensive toolkit designed to revolutionize how researchers and developers evaluate speech and audio quality.

## Why We Built VERSA

Audio quality assessment has long been fragmented across numerous specialized metrics, each requiring different setups, dependencies, and formats. This fragmentation creates significant barriers for researchers and practitioners alike:

- Implementing multiple metrics requires navigating various codebases
- Comparing results across different papers becomes challenging due to inconsistent implementations
- Setting up evaluation pipelines consumes valuable research time
- Reproducing published results is often unnecessarily difficult

VERSA solves these problems by providing a unified framework that brings together over 80 evaluation metrics under a single, easy-to-use interface.

## What Sets VERSA Apart

### Comprehensive Coverage

VERSA provides seamless access to more than 80 evaluation and profiling metrics with 10x variants, covering:

- **Perceptual quality** metrics that correlate with human perception
- **Intelligibility** measures critical for speech applications
- **Technical measurements** for detailed audio analysis
- **Distributional metrics** to evaluate statistical properties across collections

### Practical Benefits

- **Integrate once, access everything**: No need to implement multiple evaluation tools
- **Consistent interface**: Evaluate different aspects of audio quality through a unified API
- **Flexible input support**: Works with file paths, SCP files, and Kaldi-style ARKs
- **Built for scale**: Distributed evaluation support with Slurm integration
- **ESPnet compatibility**: Tightly integrated with the popular ESPnet framework

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wavlab-speech/versa.git
cd versa
pip install .
```

For metrics requiring additional dependencies, our `tools` directory provides convenient installers.

### Quick Example

Evaluating speech quality is as simple as:

```bash
python versa/bin/scorer.py \
    --score_config egs/speech.yaml \
    --gt /path/to/reference/audio \
    --pred /path/to/generated/audio \
    --output_file results \
    --io dir
```

## Real-World Applications

VERSA enables researchers and developers to:

- **Benchmark speech enhancement systems** across multiple quality dimensions
- **Evaluate text-to-speech models** for naturalness and intelligibility
- **Assess audio codec performance** with comprehensive quality metrics
- **Compare speech recognition outputs** with integrated WER and other metrics
- **Profile audio datasets** for statistical properties and quality issues
